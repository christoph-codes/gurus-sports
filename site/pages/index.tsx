					review="Great sports bar! We showed up with 10 people and were seated immediately! Our waiter was great, very attentive and memorized our drinks and brought them back perfectly! The food is super sized so come hungry! Beer and spirits menu is abundant. Really great atmosphere."

					review="Excellent food and service! We took a large group for dinner at Guru's. Jesse, our waiter, did a perfect job in taking our orders and making sure everything was delicious and everyone was served at the same time. The restaurant was nicely decorated and a great place for holding conversations while dining. We will definitely return!"
